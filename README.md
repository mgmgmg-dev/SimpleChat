# SimpleChat
SimpleChat runs on port 8081. If you want to change that you have to modify the code for both the client and the server.

The client is a simple html page, but remember to enable JavaScript on it.

To run the server open up a terminal window inside the "server" folder, then simply type "node index.js"
