# SimpleChat
SimpleChat runs on port 8082. If you want to change that you have to modify the code for both the client and the server.

The client is a simple html page, but remember to enable JavaScript on it.

To run the server open up a terminal window inside the "server" folder, then simply type "node index.js"

IMPORTANT:
You MUST create an accounts.txt file in the server folder. This file is essential for the server to work since it stores all the encrypted passwords.
